Joseph C. Slater and Raphael Timbó

Welcome to `Engineering Vibration Toolbox <http://vibrationtoolbox.github.io/vibration_toolbox/>`_.
Originally written for `Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com>`_\®, this `Python <http://python.org>`_ version is a completely new design build for modern education. This is an *educational* set of codes intended primarily for
demonstration of concepts. You may find them useful for application, but that
isn't the intent. If you have professional-level needs please `contact the authors <mailto:joseph.c.slater@gmail.com>`_.

For more information, please see the `documentation for the Python version <http://vibrationtoolbox.github.io/vibration_toolbox/>`_ but please excuse that it is still under development. Such documentation has never existed for the other ports of the toolbox so this is taking some time. We don't need feedback at this time, but we will take assistance in improving documentation and code.

You won't get everything, but you can try parts of the toolbox immediately on  and `tutorial on mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vibrationtoolbox/vibration_toolbox/binder>`_, right in your browser window.
